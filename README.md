What Need to do before run the code.

Create a Key of Type Array and call the key URL types

Open item 0 of the array and in there create an array called URL Schemes
So at this point the progression in the plist is URL types > Item 0 > URL Schemes, where URL Schemes is also an array. Is this correct? Also for the final step, if my app id is 12345, then I should have it as fb12345 with no space between fb and 12345. So in the end my key is URL types > Item 0 > URL Schemes > Item 0 and my single value is fb12345.
